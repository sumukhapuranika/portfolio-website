# Sumukha Puranika Portfolio

Minimal dark-mode developer portfolio built for a Software Engineer focused on data pipelines, APIs, backend systems, and data engineering opportunities.

## Build Note

This portfolio was built through an AI-assisted, vibe-coding workflow: the design direction, content, and engineering decisions were guided by me, while AI was used as a coding collaborator to scaffold, refine, and polish the implementation.

## Tech Stack

- Astro
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Lucide React
- Vercel

## Features

- Fast static Astro pages with partial React hydration
- Minimal dark UI with subtle grain texture and glass navigation
- Hero section with availability status and resume link
- Proof section highlighting experience, projects, certifications, and education
- Stack section aligned with Python, SQL, Flask, Pandas, SQLite, and backend tools
- Project cards for ETL/data analysis and REST API work
- Timeline for professional transition into data engineering and backend systems
- Simple connect CTA for opportunities and conversations
